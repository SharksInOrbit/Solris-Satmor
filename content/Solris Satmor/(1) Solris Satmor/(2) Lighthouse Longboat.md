### *The Relic.*
***Though the War has been over for some time, one can still see remnants of the great fleets still sailing around, their weapons melted and reforged into fishing hooks and farming implements, their crews replaced by cheerful fishing kith or pleasure cruisers. This ship is one of them.***
### Appearance

#### Rooms
##### Solris' Cabin
*Solris' cabin can be found at the top of the lighthouse. A screen sections off a corner of the room containing a bathtub and the giant, sprawling nest of pillows and blankets they use as a bed. The rest of the room contains the operation station for the light, a Kotatsu table where he reads and relaxes, and a large desk for crafting, drafting maps/charts, and sending letters. The floor of the room is covered in various mismatched rugs while the walls are absolutely covered in maps/drawings and shelves stuffed full of books and trinkets organized in a way only he understands. A door leads to the balcony with a [[(3) Solris' Packages|package]] drop-off station where Solris can sit and observe their moths
It is **very** rare for Solris to let someone up into their cabin and they have even set up a small ward to discourage others for entering.* 
##### Rooftop Garden
*The deck of the boat features a sprawling garden where Solris tends to fruit trees, small hickory/walnut trees, and other low-lying flora for their Atlas and Luna moths to feed on when they land. A string of fairy lights connects the top of the lighthouse to the lantern on the bow to help provide a small amount of light at night. There is a long picnic table in the middle of the garden and a small hut (think Junimo hut from Stardew) in the corner where Solris will sometimes sleep when he wants to be closer to the moths.*
