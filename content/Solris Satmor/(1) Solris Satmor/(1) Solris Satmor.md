***To [[Hira]]: "When did I realize I could trust you?"***
*After a situation showing me how I handle complicated choices while alone, we had to separate and when they met up with me again they helped me through the realizations and guided me onward*

***[[Hira]] to me: "What did I show you that you didn't want to see?"*** 
*Led me into a situation in which I was on my own and had to make difficult choices. They were supposed to guide me and we ended up getting separated. I learned about how I handle situations under pressure which I did not want to know and wasn't ready to find out (fear of being alone)*
#### Backstory
###### **Solris’ 1st day as a moth tender:** 
He delivered a package to a room above the tavern. When he knocks on the door, [[Beau]] opens it. He takes the package but hits [[Kago|something in his coat that makes a yelp.]] He quickly signs the paper and slams the door shut. Solris walks down to the restaurant part of the tavern and in the middle of rush hour. They're overexcited and a bit clumsy after delivering their first package, causing them to accidentally bump into a server. A knife falls off the server's tray and slices Solris' arm leaving a large gash behind. **This is the first time Solris had every been significantly hurt.** 
###### After receiving the Heavenblade
They're confused and intrigued by the Blade. They know it's important and can guess what it's capable of, but he doesn't exactly know _what_ it is. They get really invested in trying to figure out how it can be used and the history of it by becoming more social and talking to people older than them who were around during the rebellion as they deliver their letters and by collecting related books and trinkets. Solris is upset by what they find and desperately wants to do something about it. When they deliver letters they often hear snippets of what's in them and it makes them upset that they can't do anything about the little tragedies happening between people or the trauma people have faced in the aftermath of the war. They start fighting for the cause of *Change* in order to become someone who *is* both willing *and* capable of helping these people.
