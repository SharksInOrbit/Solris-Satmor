### Ten Minutes after last session
Party is sitting around a bonfire made of crystals as other gods walk around and observe them. Gods have animal-like features, foliage growing out of them, and just seem off. 
Beau is the first to speak to the gods "So you actually thought you'd be able to just leave after coming here?"  and chews the gods out for their stupidity
[[(1) Solris Satmor]] goes to talk to the [[(3) Session Three (Wanderhome 3-24-24)|three gods]] about the sword, but gets high after biting a mushroom the koi god (ponds) offered to him. "[[The Heavenblade|Sword]] talks to me in the night... why???". Ponds says that this is not their domain and directs Solris towards the goddess of blades.
[[The Author]] asks a beach god about The [[North Wind God]]. "We all could tell that a war was coming, but we don't know exactly why the kith attacked. Many kith weren't pleased with the gods, we were focusing more on our domains than the people who worshipped us". The Author asks to be taken to the North Wind God.
[[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] takes some of the crystal glowing crystal, it dims when broken and seems it's more strongly reflecting the light around it. Percival asks the crowd why the gods and the demons are fighting, there a lots of different opinions on the matter but the general consensus is "Demons interfered to much with kith's lives without respecting the boundaries of magic. They gave the kith too much magic without thinking of the consequences". Demons cause a lot of change in the way gods view as negative, a chaos that needs to be stopped.
[[Hira]] asks one of the gods what their plans for reemerging were. "The door! you know the door..." the whole crowd starts moving in a general direction. While walking Solris finds the blade god and asks why it talks. "this doesn't seem like a demon...are there any dragons left out there? I don't recognize this as my work and I don't believe any other gods would either" [[(1) Solris Satmor]] learns about [[Dragons]] in a comparison to big rocks, dragons travel in hordes in the mountains. The gods examine [[The Heavenblade]] in a careless manner and it cuts one of the gods. They freeze as if this has never happened before, it doesn't injure them but it does leave damage. 
[[The Author]] says that dragons are just fairytales the gods say the world is bigger than we think

### The Door
We come to a big door with very ornate craftmanship in a similar design to [[The Heavenblade]]. Along the doorframe there is the inscription **"Kith non sunt socii tui. Dux mundi naturalis, sive daemon sive deus, aperiet ostium"** *"Kith are not your friends. Leaders of the natural world, demons or gods to open the door"* written in an ancient language that was once spoken by both kith and gods. "Well most gods look to the [[North Wind God]] as our god, and demons look to the [[Sea Witch]] as theirs" one of the gods says. [[(1) Solris Satmor]] sees [[The Author]] speak into their staff to attempt to contact the North Wind God, and attempts to do the same with the sword (rolls a 6 pushes to an 8). It feels like a backdoor to god energy and there is *something else* there as well. There is the sense that demons cannot use it. The Author talks to their staff with mixed success and says "Hey I want to find you... what is this door... I know you say your on my side but it's getting harder to believe that" and receives a feeling of disappointment "You know you're not supposed to be here. You can open the door, just rely on me. You may take your friends but you cannot return" there is a sense of a deep connection between the God's magic and The Author's, as if they are one in the same. Becoming the avatar of either the North Wind God or the Sea Witch allows the door to be opened. 
The author goes to talk to [[Beau]] and [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]]. "So I have a choice. As much as we're all on this quest to bring back [[The Slobbering God]], I have a choice to become one with the North Wind God's magic or the Sea Witch's magic, not both. I want to continue in this gray area, and I would need one of you guys to make the decision with me." Beau says that both [[Hira]] and Percival have been affected by the [[Sea Witch]], and either could become the avatar. "They said leaders of the natural world and specified gods and demons, but they left out dragons and beings like Kago, they could also be able to open the door." 
Percival speaks up. "Well I feel like I owe a lot to the Sea Witch as she helped me regain part of myself, but I don't think we need to be hasty about this. We have [[Kago]] to open the door?". Beau responds "The Slobbering God used to be considered as something of a pandoras box. If we put Kago in this potion they may become uncontrollable.".
[[The Author]] feels like they have to make a choice here. On a roll (10) they discover that they must choose one, and will loose their relationship with the other. Someone must make a sacrifice to open this door. [[(1) Solris Satmor]] offers up to become an avatar of the dragons in connection to the sword. 
Beau thinks Hira should be the one to open the door.
### Downtime
***We have a week to get out of [[Cambria]]***
#### Basil- Wants to observe Hira's blips of unconsciousness
**Rolls a 3 on a 5, pushes to 4**
#### Solris- Wants to connect with the Heaven Blade
**Rolls a 4 on a 5, pushes to a 6**
[[(1) Solris Satmor]] takes [[The Heavenblade]] to the gods of Magic and Knowledge and explains the situation with the door. Solris expresses that they feel useless to the party in their ignorance. He wants to either know what this blade is, or pledge himself to it to be able to wield it. 
#### Hira- Goes to talk to The Author about opening the door
**Rolls a 3 on a 5/6 and pushes to a 4. Beau gives help to make it 8**
"You know your mother better than all of us. If I become her avatar, could her power and her intentions become harmful to the party? What do you know of her motivations and goals?" [[The Author]] tells her that the [[Sea Witch]] wants to have an in with as many party members as she can. "She wants you, but she also wants me. I don't know if that means more safety or something harmful. If she does take you over, I will make sure you are okay.  I will do whatever I can to stop her."
Hira goes to [[Beau]] and [[Basil]]. Beau expresses that he is more than capable of stopping Hira if need be. "I will stop you if you try to hurt your friends, but I want to stop you now. You've already lost enough you don't need to lose more" from Basil. 
Hira decides to attune herself to the [[Sea Witch]]. 
**Basil, Percival, and Solris spend tokens to bring down Hira's roll to save her from themself. The Author chooses not to, leaving the final roll as a 5.**
#### Percival- In his lane. Thriving. Goes on a nature walk to Attune with the Sea Witch
**Rolls under the oven. Critical Fail. (Rolls a 1 on a 5/6)**
There is no water in this forest. The [[Sea Witch]] needs the water to connect. Percival is just vibing with the trees.
#### The Author- Wants to find The Poet through scrying, meditation, and a sacrifice.
**Rolls a 5 on a 5/6**
They want to sacrifice the Spring Gods by letting them settle in [[Cambria]] in exchange for knowledge the forest where the poet is and how to get there. The Author meditates on the rock where we saw the centipede and feels its presence behind them. They let the presence of their gods go, and the centipede grants them with knowledge on [[Myrkvior]]. They see a fully human god in the forest taking care of the poet. In the distance they see a Parthenon behind them with three people worshipping a great statue of [[The Slobbering God]]. The Author see magic coming from their voices, most likely speaking in the language of the gods, in order to keep up the darkness of the forest.. They see a lantern with a [[Hira|barn swallow]] emerging from the darkness of the forest. 
### End of the Week
After failing their mental health rolls, [[Hira]] and [[(1) Solris Satmor]] wake up with bug features. [[The Heavenblade]] ROLLED A NAT ONE AND HAS LEGS NOW. I HATE IT HERE.
The gods examine us by comparing us different bugs. [[Basil]] notices that all of the bugs have something wrong with them, clothing, human eyes, the gods don't seem to notice this. 
Solris approaches the door with the blade and feels a hot breath deep inside of them. "Come see me to meet my champion".
Hira begins to hesitantly approach the door, but Solris takes her aside and has a heart to heart with her. "You don't need to do this if this isn't what you want." They talk about sacrifice and choosing the path that feels right. Hira seems to agree, and they start approaching the door.
[[Beau]] is at the door casting a spell, Hira and Solris assume this is either malicious or an attempt to open the door and rush him. Solris reaches him first, realizes that it's for protection, and backs down. In this pause Hira attempts to go for the door and open it. Basil attempts to stop her first in a gentle redirect, asks the author for help, and together are able to restrain Hira. Solris swings the blade to open the door after breaking past The author trying to stop them as well. There is a flash of golden light that travels through the sword, through the ornaments of the door, and causes the door to crumble down. [[(1) Solris Satmor]] has accepted the faith of a [[Dragon]].
### The Door is Open
A blast of intense heat rushes through the door. [[Beau]] pauses "We can't just leave them here". Beau motions to them in a welcome gesture, but most of them turn and walk back into the cave. [[The Author]] walks through the door, and the rest of the party follows. The knowledge god and a few others brave going through the door. 
The other side of the door is hot. The next chamber has metals and ore embedded in the wall. The amount of dust implies that no one has walked this path before. We hear a cough from deeper in the cave and a *fwoosh*. The hall gets hotter and flames spew from around the corner. The next chamber has intricately designed, colorful glass pillars and pipes with sand inside of them. Turning the corner reveals a giant pile of bismuth, a sneezing dragon. The dragon spews smoke on us.
### The Bismuth Dragon
The dragon runs towards us, trips, and falls flat on his face. "Can you like... pretend to be scared of me?" Does not work. Upon seeing the sword it invites us to sit down and talk. It asks how Liliana is doing, "Yeah what's she doing nowadays? I heard she became [[Floating Mountain King|king of a mountain]]? I gave that sword to her. Yeah I helped her kill the demons an become a god." 
Lilliana came down to the Bismuth Dragon to find her lover ([[(3) Session Three (Wanderhome 3-24-24)|god who left and went to cambia then became a bug]]). The Dragon suggest that she ascend to godhood, and then die to join her lover in the afterlife. He gave her the ring of 99 demons and [[The Heavenblade]] to allow her to ascend and kill gods.  Lilliana cut her way out of the cave as it's an extension of the [[North Wind God]] and the blade can harm is, and left the dragon behind. 

The North Wind God enlisted the help of the dragons to make weapons for the war and trapped them in the cave to make weapons forever. The Bismuth Dragon's family slowly died out leaving them behind. 

The dragon attacks after learning that the [[North Wind God]] is [[The Author]]'s father, hitting them for 2 health. Solris asks about the song of revelation. The dragon explains that the transformation into a sword signifies that war is coming. (a bunch of wack conversation that I missed) The dragon offers us magical items. 
**The Author:** *Poison licorice stick*
**Basil:** A box of five essential oils corresponding to five emotions. Don't know what's what.
**Percival:** Invisibility cloak that doubles noise
**Hira:** Clown nose. Becomes clown. 
**Solris:** Sword can turn into a bow, but it has three other forms: shit screwdriver, police siren, and water house.

Before we try to leave with the dragon [[The Author]] opens a channel with the [[North Wind God]] who says they will *only* let The Author leave. The Author chews him out. [[(1) Solris Satmor]] begins to cut a way out of the cave to take The Dragon and the gods with them. When we step out we see fire and comets. A giant face in the clouds. Fire tornados.
