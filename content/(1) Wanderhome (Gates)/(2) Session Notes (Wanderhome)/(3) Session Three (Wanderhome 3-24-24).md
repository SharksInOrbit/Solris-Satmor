### *30 Years Ago*
Desolate war torn battlefield. We see [[Beau]] carrying the body of a larger bear wearing golden armor across the field. He cries and places orchids next to the body before burying it a placing a headstone reading [[Camilla Befong]]. [[Kago]] is with him, but clearly doesn't understand what's going on. 

### *Present*
The [[Sea Witch]] emerges from the cabin to talk to[[The Author]]. She says that The Author's friends (Boat gang) have a much bigger part to play in this world and that she didn't account for the Author being there. She looks at The Author with both love and guilt. She wants The Author safe, but acknowledges that they are now a part of this. She says "*Don't trust your father*" before disappearing into the water.

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] stays behind to look in the moonpool and do the ritual correctly. Blood in the water is what caused the boat gang to be able to travel to the [[Sea Witch's Lagoon]].  Outside people are now placing offerings in the center circle. We hear whispers of a [[North Wind God]] and praying for the next season to be a good one. 

[[Kago]] barf up the [[(2) Lighthouse Longboat|Longboat]] once we get back to the pier. [[Beau]] formally asks to board the ship by doing the salute of the [[Rebellion]] to ask permission to board. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] stumbles through saluting back to grant permission and clearly fails causing Beau to give them a questioning look. Beau salutes again to ask permission for [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] to board and Solris does slightly better at the salute this time. Beau questions Solris saying "What are you doing. You're clearly copying something you don't understand and I don't appreciate it." Solris responds with "I am not uneducated, I am self-taught. I've only seen this in writing and I'm trying my best with the tools I have" leading Beau to reply with respect and an offer to teach.

Everyone goes to bed. Into the night [[Basil]] is awoken by a murmuring sound. It investigates the sound and find the bees talking to each other in human speech saying "We've got to get out of here" and are 'trying to act like bees'. 

[[The Author]] is awaken by a humming coming from their staff. It glows with a message from their father saying "I'm here". They hum back and sing a little song called "Ghost Ship."

As [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] walks into [[(2) Lighthouse Longboat|their room, they feel the ward activate]] as if someone was trying to enter the room. The tug comes from their back where [[The Heavenblade]] is. Once in the room they hear someone singing in the corner. They start barking at the voice until the sword reveals itself. Solris doesn't trust this and wraps the sword up in blankets to confine it. The sword is offended by this and mentions that it was treated better before. They do research and cannot fine anything on swords, but can find that enchantments are a thing that can be performed by *very* powerful wizards but nothing as big and permanent as this. In the morning Solris locks the sword in his room where it *keeps talking.*

[[Beau]] is the first to wake up and starts making breakfast for everyone with the help of [[Basil]]. Beau takes deep care in cooking. [[Kago]] goes to eat the entire table, but gets stopped by Beau before she can. Things are tense. Beau explains that he made breakfast as a peace offering. [[The Author]] sleepily enters, says "[[Sea Witch|mom]] likes you" then sits down. Beau continues saying : 
"TLDR, Kago needs a lot of bones and she can now *sense* these bones. There's about 300 wolf-like bones of [[The Slobbering God]] and we need to collect them, then bring them to the [[Sea Witch]]" He says that the sea witch is a little bit evil, it's going to take a *long time* to find them, and that he is the main person in this mission, but he would appreciate some help. 

[[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] goes to put a hand on [[Beau]]'s shoulder and immediately gets decked, losing one heart. [[Hira]] asks what the purpose of collecting these bones would be, Beau explains that [[Kago]] would become powerful enough to re-become [[The Slobbering God]], bringing violence and change back into the world. The [[Sea Witch]] believes this would make the world a better place. He mentions the [[Floating Mountain King]] and that she is still in power, and implies that it would be impossible to dethrone him without violence. 

[[Basil]] guides [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] in a salute acknowledges [[Beau]]'s grief which he returns. Beau says that he has his own reasons for doing this, but he is *not* here to kill. [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] says to Beau (from a distance) "I want help you. The way things are right now isn't right, and it's not helping people in the way that it should." 

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] asks how [[Kago]] will be involved. [[Beau]] says that Kago is a small part of [[The Slobbering God]] and that she appeared with the bones when the God was killed. [[The Author]] asks how Beau knows their mom the [[Sea Witch]]. He says that he learned of her while studying Demonology at [[Scoripast]] college before becoming a teacher there around 15 years ago. 

[[Beau]] says that there will most likely be a ritual at the end and casually does some very complicated magic. The magic he performs smells Godly/divine but not necessarily special. Beau says he wants to take a nap and [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] leads him to a separate room under theirs in the [[(2) Lighthouse Longboat|Lighthouse.]] Beau hears the [[The Heavenblade]] yapping and asks about it. After Solris explains he says that "If something that shouldn't talks starts talking, you should probably kill it." 
### *Downtime*
*Order: Solris, Percival, The Author, Hira, Basil*
#### *Solris*
[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] brings the [[The Heavenblade]] to train with [[Beau]] and invites [[Basil]] to give pointers and a history lesson. (*Rolls a 6 on a 3*)
Beau asks about how Solris got the blade and says "Not even a wizard would be able to do this, it would have to be a full big God or a being of pure magic like a dragon or something. It's possible that it could have been the [[Floating Mountain King]] since she has almost ascended to Godhood." He tells Solris that swords are used for violence and that he has killed before. "People can't process murder when they don't know that's a possibility, so don't be afraid to *kill*." Also gives a basic war history lesson.
***Second Round***
[[(1) Solris Satmor]] wants to invite [[Beau]] and [[Basil]] down into the [[(2) Lighthouse Longboat|hull]] to look at the things left behind *(rolls a 5 on a five*)
Beau gives a propaganda-esq view of the [[Rebellion]], saying that they were the good guys doing glorious deeds. He talks about how the [[Floating Mountain King]] swallowed up other kingdoms for her cause and wiped them out. They also learn that Beau's mother was a leader of the rebellion and that Beau respects and idolizes her. He avoids talking about what she actually did. Basil tells Solris about the darker parts of how the rebellion hurt people. Beau disapproves. Basil says "People got hurt by each other, people got cast out, I got the injuries." Solris now gets advantage on persuasion/talking to people about the rebellion.
#### *Percival*
[[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] wants to learn about[[Magic|healing and resurrection magic]] from [[Beau]] and [[The Author]]. (*They roll 3+1 on a 7. Beau gives them 2 pushing them to 6 for the next round*.) 
Beau says that you can never bring something back the way they were before. He knows a bit too much about this topic as if it's a special interest for him and says you would need "The body, an *extremely magical* source (place, item, God), and a sacrifice from yourself." Percival gains small healing magic from this. They ask the Author who says "I cannot teach you how to heal, that is something you have to learn for yourself and everyone does it in their own way. When I do it I try to use nature, things that are or once were alive. This is what works for me and it may not work for you."
***Second Round***
[[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] now knows how to perform [[Magic|resurrection]] and learns that [[Beau]] is trying to resurrect someone. He has plans for the future. Percival can now heal without rolling.
#### *The Author*
[[The Author]] wants to attempt to talk with the [[North Wind God]] to get back into the routine of talking to him (*Father???*). (*They roll a 1+1 on a 5*)
They say "I'm sorry I was gone for so long, but I'm back now" and the message get heard.
***Second Round***
[[The Author]] wants to talk to [[Hira]] about their [[Sea Witch|mom]]. (*no roll*)
"I don't know the specifics on your engagement with her, but be careful. she has her own motivations ad will convince you of anything to achieve those goals." [[The Author]] wants to make Hira understand. "Before I found that knife I had a huge chunk of memory around the [[Sea Witch]] missing. I know how it is to have memories missing. If you want to know more about her just ask." Hira replies "I want to ask for a favor? If I loose myself and I don't recognize it..." "Stop you?" "Stop me." "Whatever it takes?" "If I'm about to hurt someone... then yes whatever it takes."
[[The Author]] talks to the [[North Wind God]] again. "I know you can hear me and you can't respond, but I do want to reconnect. I'm sorry for not responding". The North Wind God responds with images of the meteor shower, a feeling of *no*, and a feeling of *Help me* through another channel. Not the North Wind God, but perhaps someone with a similar situation as [[The Author]].
#### *Hira*
[[Hira]] would like to talk to [[Beau]] about [[Magic]] to learn about their pact *(with the [[Sea Witch]]?)* in order to understand it (*They roll a 6 on a 4*)
She awkwardly initiates the conversation with "I just wanted to talk about...what happened?". Beau also wanted to talk about it and what happened with their feathers all going black and going unconscious. They talk and Beau says "Yeah when I was first learning magic I had a lot of trouble. It has to do with your emotional state, your ego, your persona and if you're struggling to control those you may struggle with your magic as well." It's a therapeutic conversation, but Hira is clearly not talking about the emotional state aspect of things causing a block in the conversation. Beau explains that "All wishes come at a cost. Your cost might be your feathers and a lack of control causing you to struggle with your magic." Beau explains more about magic and [[Hira]] gains advantage on magic rolls and disadvantage on being controlled. There are times where they will blank out for a minute or so.
***Second Round*** 
[[Hira]] wants to research what her mom was trying to do. She does this specifically by reading books in public places around [[Beau]] (*Rolls a 3+1 on 9*)
They discover that the [[Floating Mountain King]] was a tyrannical leader and that the kingdoms she conquered are now in the sky. The kingdom is a huge, isolated, mobile country in the sky. People have escaped but not much is known about it. Hira discovers that their mom has some knowledge about the King and that the King is trying to ascending Godhood purely for power.
#### *Basil*
[[Basil]] realizes that the Bees are off and wants to figure out what's going on with them through food (*Rolls a 3 on a 3*)
Basil goes to [[Beau]] with food to ask for his help (Beau appreciates this). The bees seem to be anti-Basil, they were in the song of revelation, and are able to talk because of this. Basil tries to explain food preparation and life skills to the bees and diversify their diet. Basil feels lie it has trapped these sentient bees and feels guilty for this, they want to atone. The bees appreciate this. 
***Second Round***
[[Basil]] spends a die to help [[Hira]] with research. (*Rolls a 3, bringing Hira up to 8 on a 9*)
They do more research together and find small religious texts about demons mentioning [[Myrkvior]] (*The dark forest connected to [[The Author]] that [[Hira]] refuses to go to)*. They find ports for airships that rarely go up to the Mountain Kingdom. Her mom was vaguely talking about the forest before going up.
#### *Everyone*
[[Kago]] barks and jumps off the boat before running to a decrepit, military tower. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] follows and they find a wrist bone on top of a desk. The bone is much larger than it should be and takes up the entire desk. [[Beau]] nervously says "uhh... do your thing Kago..." and Kago gnaws on and swallows the bone. She grows a little bit after this. 
We find bones and other thing with connections to the [[Floating Mountain King]]. Kago gives a lot off false-positives on the bone locations, but she says that it seems as though someone moved them. It seems like it may take about 10 years to find bones, but we get they feeling that there is a big collection of bones somewhere and what were finding are just ones that got scattered. We find more bones the more central we go. 
[[Beau]] says that there will be a meteor shower soon. The meteor shower is a famous part of [[Devildays]] and if we head towards that are it is likely we'll find more bones.

### *After Downtime. Devildays.*
The boat gang is planning a trip to go see the [[Devildays|Meteor Shower]], but [[The Author]] seems very against this and isn't convinced to go until after their Gods drag them.

The mountain is hot and miserable, [[Beau]] insists that it will get better and [[Magic|magicks]] a rain cloud above the boat gang's heads. Once getting to the top we set up for a picnic. This is the first time we see Beau relax around us, he seems really happy to be here.

[[Hira]] feels secure, she feels *good* and happy to here at the top of the mountain with their friends. [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] is also feeling better as a snake in the sun. Everyone is having a good time building community with one another (except for The Author who is *not* having a good time. 

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] initiates a friendly sparring match with [[Beau]] ending in a tie near sunset. Beau starts to have a heart to heart about how he's really happy to be here, then pauses and immediately drops in mood among realizing [[Kago]] is missing.

On a missed success roll we can't find Kago. We find footsteps leading into a deeply wooded area, [[Beau]] sprints towards it, knocking over candles in his wake. Fire immediately spreads starting a small forest fire in the camp area. We roll to see how hurt we get (*anyone who failed the roll pushed to a mixed success*). [[Basil]] is able to follow Beau on [[Kago]]'s tracks into a cave and protect him while everyone else gets separated and isolated from the group. 

[[The Author]] and [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] find each other and search for [[Basil]], [[Hira]] tries to find [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]], and Solris tries to find [[Kago]]. Solris is able to find a safe cave, The author and Percival find the cave with [[Basil]] and [[Beau]], and Hira is still trapped in the forest. Hira takes 2 damage before finding a third cave.

Basil and Beau start walking deeper into the cave with Percival and The author, Basil tries to keep everyone calm. [[The Author]] makes on offering to the god of this caves and feels a chorus of "thank you" along with a disapproving vibe from their [[North Wind God|dad]].

[[Hira]] keeps going trying to find their friends, ignoring the pain. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] sniffs to find anyone or anything and senses a lot of Godly energy from hundreds or different sources (*same smell as [[The Heavenblade]]*), A different energy from one powerful God, and a third scent that can't be identified. They head deeper

As everyone heads deeper into their caves, leading us into a [[Hollow]]. As we walk deeper things become more structured (*pillars, stairs, etc*) [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] comes across some crudely handcrafted statues that seem to be a lot newer than everything around them (*They don't recognize it being a Kith, but these statues are quite uncannily humanoid*). [[Hira]] hears unintelligible muttering as they walk deeper. They pause and call out "Who's there?" The muttering stops and she hears footsteps running away. She follows.  

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] and [[Hira]] meet up in the and area of the cave that is very structured as a central room with offshoots. Solris describes the statues for Hira but feels a strong presence of eyes watching them and a negative feeling when they try to turn back. We hear lots of footsteps coming towards us from one of the caves, Solris takes out the [[The Heavenblade]] and it glows for the first time. Solris smells Demon coming from deeper in the cave. 

[[Hira]] finds a semi-recent rich, expensive looking, red fabric that was ripped off a kith and pockets it. Solris and Hira head deeper into the cave away from the footsteps and close the door behind them.

[[The Author]] and [[Beau]] see something disappear through a closed door and chase after it. [[Hira]] senses that [[Kago]] definitely rushed in this direction. The group reconvenes in a cave down the big tunnel leading deeper. The cave is now extremely developed as a hallway. [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] heals Hira for 1 damage. We hear more footsteps coming towards us (*same little footsteps Hira heard earlier*). 

"***HELLO???***" a two-foot tall, star-nosed mole with golden jewelry comes down the hallway towards us. [[The Author]] recognizes this voice and stops immediately. The mole asks if we're new here and says "we've haven't had new people in a long time." 

[[Basil]] asks [[The Author]] what's going on and they say "It's... me. You asked for help and... your me". The Author attempts to communicate through their staff to send a message to the Mole. They say "You asked for help. Come closer." The mole changes in demeanor but does not come closer. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] points out that it's suspicious and could be an ambush then tells [[Beau]] they don't think we should do this. The group goes deeper towards the mole. 

The mole says "You guys need help?" [[The Author]] points out that it was the mole who initially asked for help. They say "No I'm helping you. Don't worry you're all safe here, all gods are safe here." The Author holds out the staff to prove we are not gods and they get a vibe from her of "you are brave to come here."

She says "Look I know you don't want to be here, but the [[North Wind God]] knows best, this is their safe house you're safe here." The backtracking rule seemingly doesn't apply to her. She says "I can lead you through or I can lead you out but you're not safe out there, the Kith are out there and it's dangerous out there." We tell her that we're looking for someone. [[The Author]] asks for her name and she does not give it, but says we can refer to her as the [[Avatar of the North Wind God]].

She says "I can take you deeper or I can take you out, but if you're going to the Safe Haven, but if you go to the Safe Haven you gotta stay there". We head "Outside" and area before the Safe Haven that looks like a war torn field, soldiers are moving to different outposts, [[Rebellion]] figure heads are here, swords, arrows, and pink orchids litter the place. We get the sense that either a battle has happened or will happen soon. [[Beau]] and [[Basil]] seem shell-shocked by this sight. 

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] tells [[Beau]] that [[Kago]] either is here or was here. Solris hones their smell and discovers that Kago has left this area and is bleeding. Soldiers see the group and start bolting towards a fort. An arrow comes at [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] and they see a battalion coming at them. [[The Author]] gets hit trying to protect them, they can feel the blood and the arrow in them but they have a sense that that didn't happen to *them.*

Upon seeing his friends get hurt, [[Beau]] throws a fireball and joins a group in attempt to cross the battlefield. [[Basil]] stops Beau from throwing another fireball by saying "Beau this is war. We're not doing war again." Beau summons a shield and we start heading towards a blue jay beckoning us into a building.

While running [[Hira]] sees the group glitch into humans. We look godlike. [[Basil]] recognizes that all of this is fake. Things in the distance look like things from its memories that *should not be here*. This place is trying to take from the group's memories to make it make sense. The people attacking us see us as gods and are attacking us because of this. Basil tries to make us go to the cave while the rest of us try to get to the blue jay. 

[[Beau]] see a flash of gold armor in the house and is determined to go towards it. When we get inside we see a group of at least twenty people inside. [[Basil]], [[The Author]], and [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] recognize people from their past. A [[Camilla Befong|giant bear]] sits behind a desk at the head of the room. She starts talking but it fades to static and "Get the gods" is heard over after whatever she says.

[[Beau]] runs forward to hug his mom and takes 3 damage from the people around him. As a group we pull Beau away, and [[(1) Solris Satmor]] and [[The Author]] recognize the [[(3) Solris' Packages|blue jay]] as a person from their pasts.

We get out of there and go into the cave. The mole says "Yeah that sucks, but that's how it's like for Gods like you, you can't fight it." [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] grabs the mole who then pulls out a knife and stabs them. [[Basil]] tries to kill them and gets thrown away by a gust of wind. [[The Author]] threatens to tell their parents about this. The mole starts walking down the hall and we are forced to follow.

Bioluminescent mushrooms as tall as trees and foliage fill this cavern. A human being walks by. The mole says "you guys go" and walks backwards and away. The cavern is filled with giant reptilian/beastial bugs and Gods. As we walk deeper we here a loud, earth shaking rumble. A gigantic Hercules beetle thunders past. 

We see a couple of humanoid figures going about there day not taking notice to us. This area is where the many god smells were coming from, it's coming from both the humans and the bugs. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] smells that [[Kago]] is still in this area. We come across a giant, curled centipede with glyphs on it on a huge rock. [[The Author]] asks it for help and the centipede looks at it as "do I know this person? no I don't." The Author asks for help finding out friend and puts a hand on the centipede. They get a sense of guilt and "I lost a friend once". They lift and reveal a journal and angelic clothing.

The journal has a diary entry from "Trees" dated to five years before the war. It starts with the writer talking about their love for a mortal partner. They talk as if they are a god. A later entry talks about the growing violence and war among the kith. The next entry says the [[North Wind God]] has offered them a home, but they can't take their love with them. The last entry we read says they left for the home without telling their love out of fear for their safety. 

[[Basil]] and [[Hira]] stay with [[Beau]] to help him. [[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] leaves to follow [[Kago]]'s scent and [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] follow. We come across a clearing with three humanoid figures, one is decorated with gold and silver jewelry, one is covered in hair, and one is made of lily pads with koi fish swimming through them. They ask Solris "Cassidina is this you? no I saw her somewhere else..." Solris asks about [[Kago]] and they point to her in the corner. They look fine except for her leg does not seem to be attatched. It seems to be dealt with but it's still concerning.

As [[(1) Solris Satmor]] goes to leave the humans stop them and asks "Oh where are you going? last time you stayed for longer". They keep talking to Solris as if they were a god who's been here before until Solris explains that they're not. They say "Oh you're not Liliana? you're not looking for your lover?" and Solris explains that they have no idea what they're talking about. The rest of the party catches up

### *God Lore Dump*
Five years before the war the [[North Wind God]] warned the Gods that the kith were coming for them as the Kith were becoming more aggressive. They tell the gods that they have two options: either join the fight or go to the Safe House where the kith couldn't bother them. The three gods say they went to the safe house for a while before deciding to leave. When they expressed this the star nose mole took them "outside" where they saw the war, saw their loved ones dying, and got attacked. After that they stayed at [[Cambria]] for about ten years *(wrong*) as they were more passive nature gods not meant for fighting.

They say that one rabbit kith (Liliana) showed up five years ago and asked for help finding a loved one before somehow leaving. They haven't seen that kith since.

They said that the door to leave would be opened when it was safe. They were told that the kith had a toxic gas that would kill them all if they opened the door.
### *Present*
[[Basil]] tells them the [[North Wind God]] was lying to them and the three gods don't believe this. [[Percival (REDACTED), The Forgotten]] explains that [[Kago]] is a baby version of [[The Slobbering God]] and that the [[Floating Mountain King]] is the one that started the war and killed the Slobbering God so violence would no longer exist. We tell them that there are still demons.

[[(1) Solris Satmor|Solris]] tells them that violence was brought back into the world when they got the [[The Heavenblade]]. Lilliana apparently also had the blade with her when she came through.
