## Initial Launch 5/28/24

***Hello Besties.***
We're essentially in the beta testing phase of this right now. This is most of what I currently have in my obsidian, and there's a lot of links leading to nowhere and empty files. The links on my character specifically are probably all going to be broken since I made a different file for my character without my secret shit and I haven't updated the notes and stuff. I'll update and fix things more when I find time probably after this week. Check out the [[(0) READ ME]] if you haven't already.
#### Updates
- **Site Created**
- File Tree added
- Table of contents added
