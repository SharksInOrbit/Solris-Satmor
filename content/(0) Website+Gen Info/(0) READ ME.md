*Guys this is so cool I'm so cool everyone be proud of me*
Okay so this is a website created from my (Dio's) Wanderhome Obsidian! On the left you'll see the entire file tree with the folders I have set up, the middle is your viewing window, and the right should have the graph and the table of contents for the page you're viewing! 
This site ***Does Not*** update automatically, but I will try to update it soon after each session to at least include the new session notes. If anyone ever has something they want to update the site with something you can either DM me the info/google doc link and where you want it to go, if it's something already in the discord reply to the message and @ me, or drop it in the new Website Updates channel in the server! I'll let y'all know there whenever I update the site.

**Website Updates**
Just because it's my files doesn't mean this is *my site* I want this to be completely collaborative between all of us. Feel free to suggest any kinds of updates you want to see even if it's something small like more icons or color changes to things. Also don't be afraid to ask for things like easier to read formatting or more features like plugins. Plugins can let you do *a whole lot of cool shit* so if there's something you want added either send me a link to the specific plugin you want or just ask "hey can you add something like this..." and I'll try to find one that fits your vision.
I'm going to try to see if there's a way for me to let others update the site, but I don't think that's likely. I am going to try though.

Be sure to also check out the [[(1) Update Log|Update Log]] so you can see exactly what's been changed when I update.
